Explanation for the directory:
- DTW 18SeptemberPlein_Opening 
		This folder contains all the Choregraphe project files we used at the "Slimmer Leven Huis"
		http://www.slimmerleven2020.org/nieuws/opening-slimmer-leven-huis-dutch-technology-week
- DTW Parktheather_Opening
		The official start of the DTW opening at the parktheater had a general concept. "The robots are already among the people" and welcomed, entertained and informed the visitors. All files included what were used during the opening. 
- DTW Control Panel
		To control multiple NAO's at once to create a solid performance we wrote an interface. README file inside with all the additional software you'll need to use to get yourself up and running.
